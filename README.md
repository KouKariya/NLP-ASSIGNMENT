#Natural Language Processing Project by Jesse Gallarzo
Computer Science applications such as Information Retrieval and Speech Understanding make use of statistics calculated on trigrams. A trigram is a three-element sequence of words(e.g., "the") encountered in a corpus (a file containing some text of interest, e.g., Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet).

This project creates trigrams(3 letter word parsed from words within a .txt file), stores them in a list and shows the frequency of a trigram within the input(a .txt file) and the probability of that trigram appearing within a .txt file.

##Starting the Program
Before starting the program, ensure that the IDE you are choosing specifies an argument for the program. The argument is the name of the text file that you want to run the statistics off of. If you want to run the example files within the project, just put in "test.txt" or "829-0.txt" as the argument. Run "Main.java" to start the program.
